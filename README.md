# Airic - NASA Space Apps Challenge

## The Challenge: Aircheck

Develop an app or platform to crowd-source information for comparing changes in environmental factors, such as temperature, relative humidity, air pollution, with occurrence of symptoms of allergies and respiratory diseases.
Create tools for public entry and grading of symptoms, including but not limited to cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, sneezing, nasal obstruction, itchy eyes; and geographic mapping of symptom frequency and intensity.
Create a platform for comparison of symptom map with NASA provided data, with visualization options for web and/or smart phone.

## Explanation

Our target is combining symptom data of respiratory deseases with geolocation-tagged weather and air quality data.

At the challenge, we have built a 3d-printed measurement case with sensors and mounted it on a quadcopter drone and a bike.
We also built a data science platform and connected it to weather and air quality data in Vienna and abroad.
Lastly, we created an Android app for patients to track their symptoms.
